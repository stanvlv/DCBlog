        <h2>What is the DC Universe?</h2>
        <img alt="Picture of the DC Universe heroes" src="/dc-universe-all.jpg">
        <p class="dc-exp">The DC Universe (DCU) is the fictional shared universe where most stories in American comic 
book titles published by DC Comics take place. Superheroes such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, 
Martian Manhunter, The Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, and Green Arrow are from this universe, as well
 as teams such as the Justice League and the Teen Titans. It also contains well-known supervillains 
 such as the Joker, Lex Luthor, Catwoman, Deathstroke, Reverse-Flash, Black Manta, the Penguin, the 
 Riddler, the Scarecrow, Ra's al Ghul, Sinestro, Brainiac, and Darkseid. In context, the term 
 "DC Universe" usually refers to the main DC continuity. The term "DC Multiverse" 
 refers to the collection of all continuities within DC Comics publications. 
 Within the Multiverse, the main DC Universe has gone by many names, but in recent years has been 
 referred to by "Prime Earth" (not to be confused with "Earth Prime") or "Earth 0".
 The main DC Universe, as well as the alternate realities related to it, were quickly adapted to 
 other media such as film serials or radio dramas. In subsequent decades, the continuity between 
 all of these media became increasingly complex with certain storylines and events designed to 
 simplify or streamline the more confusing aspects of characters' histories.</p></div>

    <h3>Description of the DCU</h3>
    <img id='dc-second' alt="Picture of the DC Universe heroes" src="/dc-universe-description.webp">
    <p>The basic concept of the DC Universe is that it is just like the real world, 
        but with superheroes and supervillains existing in it. However, 
        there are other corollary differences resulting from the justifications implied by that main 
        concept. Many fictional countries, such as Qurac, Vlatava, and Zandia, exist in it. 
        Though stories are often set in the United States of America, they are as often as not 
        set in fictional cities, such as Gotham City or Metropolis. These cities are effectively 
        archetypes of cities, with Gotham City embodying more of the negative aspects of life in a 
        large city, and Metropolis reflecting more of the positive aspects. Sentient alien species 
        (such as Kryptonians and Thanagarians) and even functioning interstellar societies 
        are generally known to exist, and the arrival of alien spacecraft is not uncommon. 
        Technologies which are only theoretical in the real world, such as artificial intelligence
         or are outright impossible according to modern science, such as faster-than-light travel,
          are functional and reproducible, though they are often portrayed as highly experimental 
          and difficult to achieve. Demonstrable magic exists and can be learned. 
          The general history of the fictional world is similar to the real one 
          (for instance, there was a Roman Empire, and World War II and 9/11 both occurred), 
          but many fantastic additions exist, such as the known existence of Atlantis. 
          In recent years, stories have increasingly described events which bring the DC Universe 
          farther away from reality, such as World War III occurring, Lex Luthor being elected as 
          President of the United States in 2000, and entire cities and countries being destroyed. 
          There are other minor variations, such as the Earth being slightly larger than ours 
          (to accommodate the extra countries), and the planet Saturn having 18 moons rather than 
          19 because Superman destroyed one.</p>
