  <h2>Princess Diana of Themyscira - Wonder Woman</h2>
  <img alt="Photo of Wonder Woman" id="wonderwoman-first" src="wonderwoman.jpg">
  <p>Wonder Woman appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character is a founding member of the
     Justice League. The character first appeared in All Star Comics #8 published October 21, 1941 with her first
      feature in Sensation Comics #1 in January 1942. The Wonder Woman title has been published by DC Comics almost
       continuously ever since.In her homeland, the island nation of Themyscira, her official title is Princess
        Diana of Themyscira. When blending into the society outside of her homeland, she sometimes adopts her
         civilian identity Diana Prince. Wonder Woman's origin story (from Golden to Bronze Age) relates that 
         she was sculpted from clay by her mother Queen Hippolyta and was given a life as an Amazon, along with
          superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek gods. In 2011, DC changed her background with the retcon that 
          she is the biological daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, jointly raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope
           and Menalippe. The character has changed in depiction over the decades, including briefly losing her 
           powers entirely in the late 1960s; by the 1980s, artist George Perez gave her an athletic look and 
           emphasized her Amazonian heritage. She possesses an arsenal of magical items, including the 
           Lasso of Truth, a pair of indestructible bracelets, a tiara which serves as a projectile, and, in older
            stories, a range of devices based on Amazon technology.</p>

    <h3>Diana Prince</h3>
    <img alt="Photo of Wonder Woman 2017" id="wonderwoman-second" src="dianaprince.jpg">
      <p>The "battle pass" identity has been part of Wonder Woman's history since her comics debut in 1941. 
        In the early Golden Age stories, Wonder Woman served as a military secretary during World War II, 
        using Prince as her cover. Later occupations Wonder Woman performed as Prince included translator 
        at the United Nations, Air Force captain and ambassador, and in the '70s TV series, Lynda Carter's
         Wonder Woman used Prince to serve as an agent of the Inter-Agency Defense Command. In the DC Extended 
         Universe, Prince works as curator for the Department of Antiquities[56] at the extremely prestigious 
         Louvre Museum and is held in very high esteem by the curator of the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities.
          Her tremendously long life span, accumulation of immense amount of knowledge and exceptional 
          perceptiveness makes Diana Prince the wisest and most emotionally-intelligent female member of the 
          Justice League. During Marston's run, Diana Prince was the name of an army nurse whom Wonder Woman met. 
          The nurse wanted to meet with her fiancé, who was transferred to South America, but was unable to arrange
           for money to do so. As Wonder Woman needed a secret identity to look after Steve (who was admitted to the
            same army hospital in which Diana Prince worked), and because both of them looked alike, Wonder Woman
             gave the nurse money to go to her fiancé in exchange for the nurse's credentials and took Diana Prince
              as her alias.[59] She started to work as an army nurse and later as an Air Force secretary. 
              The identity of Diana Prince was especially prominent in a series published in the early 1970s, in 
              which she fought crime only under the Prince alias and without her mystic powers. To support herself,
               she ran a mod clothing boutique.</p>
    <h4>Abilities</h4>
    <img alt="Wonder Woman abilities" id="wonderwoman-third" src="wonderwoman-superpower.jpg">
            <p>Diana is depicted as a masterful athlete, acrobat, fighter and strategist, trained and experienced
               in many ancient and modern forms of armed and unarmed combat, including exclusive Amazonian martial 
               arts. With her godlike abilities of incalculable superhuman strength, nigh-invulnerability, speed, 
               flight, fast healing and semi-immortality, Diana's fighting prowess is enhanced. In some versions, 
               her mother trained her, as Wonder Girl, for a future career as Wonder Woman. From the beginning, 
               she is portrayed as highly skilled in using her Amazon bracelets to stop bullets and in wielding
                her golden lasso. Batman once called her the "best melee fighter in the world". The modern 
                version of the character is known to use lethal force when she deems it necessary. In the New 
                52 continuity, her superior combat skills are the result of her Amazon training, as well as
                 receiving further training from Ares, the God of War, himself, since as early as her childhood. 
                 The Golden Age Wonder Woman also had education in advanced arts and sciences as well as 
                 psychology, emotions, and emotional intelligence, as did her Amazon sisters.

    <h5>Enemies</h5>
    <img alt="The enemies of Wonder Woman" id="enemies" src="wonderwoman-enemies.webp">
               <p>Wonder Woman has a fair number of villains. Her first major enemy, and often the main reason
                 for her superhero career, is the God of War Ares (or, earlier, Mars). Other prominent enemies
                  include multiple incarnations of the Cheetah, the sorceress Circe, the misogynist Doctor Psycho
                   and the giantess Giganta. Some of her villains teamed up as Villainy, Inc.</p>
