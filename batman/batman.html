  <h2>Bruce Wayne - The Batman</h2>
  <img alt="Photo of Batman" id="batman-first" src="batman.webp">
  <p>Batman is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. 
    The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 
    27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, 
    Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist
     who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance against 
     criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha, who were robbed and 
     shot to death infront of an eight-year-old Bruce, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice.
      He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors 
      the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman with 
      supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred Pennyworth, 
      James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, and his archenemy 
      the Joker.</p>

    <h2>One of the most iconic characters</h2>
    <img alt="Photo of Batman in rain" id="batman-second" src="batman-2.jpg">
      <p>One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, Batman has been listed among the 
        greatest comic book superheroes and fictional characters ever created. He is one of the 
        most commercially successful superheroes, and his likeness has been licensed and featured
         in various media and merchandise sold around the world; this includes toy lines such as 
         Lego Batman and video games like the Batman: Arkham series. Batman has been adapted in 
         live-action and animated incarnations, including the 1960s Batman television series played 
         by Adam West and in film by Michael Keaton in Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992), 
         and The Flash (2023), Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995), George Clooney in Batman and 
         Robin (1997), Christian Bale in The Dark Knight trilogy (2005-2012), Ben Affleck in the 
         DC Extended Universe (2016-present), and Robert Pattinson in The Batman (2022).
          Kevin Conroy (also made live action debut in Crisis on infinite earths), Diedrich Bader,
           Jensen Ackles, Will Arnett, Jimmy Kimmel, and Keanu Reeves, among others, have provided
            the character's voice.</p>

    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <img alt="Batman Gadgets" id="batman-third" src="batman-gadgets.webp">
            <p>Batman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on "his own scientific knowledge, detective 
              skills, and athletic prowess". Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced 
              technologies, and as a proficient scientist, he is able to use and modify these technologies to 
              his advantage. In the stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world's greatest detectives, if 
              not the world's greatest crime solver. Batman has been repeatedly described as having a 
              genius-level intellect, being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, and having 
              peak human physical conditioning.] As a polymath, his knowledge and expertise in countless 
              disciplines is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe. He has traveled
               the world acquiring the skills needed to aid him in his endeavors as Batman. In the Superman: 
               Doomed story arc, Superman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet.

    <h2>Enemies</h2>
    <img alt="The enemies of Batman" id="enemies" src="enemies.jpeg">
               <p>Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. 
                Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, 
                often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime. These foes
                 are commonly referred to as Batman's rogues gallery. Batman's "most implacable foe" is the 
                 Joker, a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is considered by critics 
                 to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance;
                  the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and 
                  resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a "personification of the irrational", the Joker
                   represents "everything Batman opposes". Other long-time recurring foes that are part of 
                   Batman's rogues gallery include Catwoman (a cat burglar anti-heroine who is an occasional ally
                    and romantic interest), the Penguin, Ra's al Ghul, Two-Face, the Riddler, the Scarecrow, Mr. 
                    Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Bane, Clayface, and Killer Croc, among others. Many 
                    of Batman's adversaries are often psychiatric patients at Arkham Asylum.</p>
