  <h2>Justice League</h2>
  <img alt="Photo of the Justice League" id="justiceleague-first" src="justiceleague.jpg">
  <p>The Justice League is a team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. 
    The team first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #28 (March 1960). The team was conceived by writer 
    Gardner Fox as a revival of the Justice Society of America, a similar team from DC Comics from the 
    1940s which had been pulled out of print due to a decline in sales. The Justice League is an all-star 
    ensemble cast of established superhero characters from DC Comics' portfolio. Diegetically, these 
    superheroes usually operate independently but occasionally assemble as a team to tackle especially 
    formidable villains. This in contrast to certain other superhero teams such as the X-Men, whose characters
     were created specifically to be part of the team, with the team being central to their identity. 
     The cast of the Justice League usually features a few highly popular characters who have their own 
     solo books, such as Superman, alongside a number of lesser-known characters who benefit from exposure, 
     such as Cyborg.[1] The Justice League was created to boost the profiles and sales of said characters
      through cross-promotion and helped develop the DC Universe as a shared universe, as it is through
       teams like the Justice League that the setting's characters regularly interact with each other. Beyond 
       comic books, the Justice League has been adapted to a number of television shows, movies, and video
        games.</p>

    <h2>Members</h2>
    <img alt="Photo of Batman in rain" id="justiceleague-second" src="members.jpg">
      <p>The members of the Justice League are heroes who normally operate independently but who occasionally 
        team up to tackle especially formidable villains. This is in contrast to teams such as the X-Men or 
        the Fantastic Four, who normally operate as a team and for whom the team is central to their identity.
        Most versions of the Justice League feature a select cast of highly popular characters from the DC 
        Comics portfolio, such as Superman and Batman, to attract readers with their star power; and they often
         co-feature a few lesser-known characters who benefit from exposure, such as Cyborg or Black Canary. 
         DC Comics has in several periods deviated from this formula, most notably in the late 1980s and early
          1990s with books such as Justice League International, which deliberately featured a cast of 
          lesser-known characters. The advantage of this was that lesser-known characters are not burdened by 
          convoluted continuities, which gives writers more creative flexibility to write character-driven 
          stories. This was done to emulate the model of Marvel Comics' X-Men books, whose stories were more 
          character-driven and which favored more obscure or even new characters. The Justice League is an 
          independent group, although it usually accepts some constraints from the US government or the United
           Nations so as to receive their sanction. Particularly in the early decades of publication, 
           DC Comics was keen for its superheroes to be perceived as law-abiding because children were the 
           main audience. The cast is rarely more than a dozen people in size so as to give a reasonable and 
           equal time for each character. While sometimes the League is shown to have a designated chairperson
            or leader, there is otherwise no hierarchy; they are a small band of equals who make major 
            decisions, such as inducting new members, by vote.</p>

    <h2>Enemies</h2>
    <img alt="The enemies of Justice League" id="enemies" src="legionofdoom.jpg">
               <p>The Legion of Doom was created for the Challenge of the Super Friends animated TV series as
                 a villainous counterpart to the Justice League. In that original incarnation, it consisted of
                 established villains associated with each of the Justice League's members, e.g. Lex Luthor
                  for Superman, Gorilla Grodd for the Flash, and Cheetah for Wonder Woman. The Legion of Doom,
                  or some variant of it, has since appeared in other TV shows and comic books.</p>
