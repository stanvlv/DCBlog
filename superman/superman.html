  <h2>Clark Kent - The Superman</h2>
  <img alt="Photo of Superman" id="superman-first" src="superman.webp">
  <p>Superman is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. 
    The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, and debuted in the comic book
     Action Comics #1 (cover-dated June 1938 and published April 18, 1938).[1] Superman has been adapted to 
     a number of other media, which includes radio serials, novels, films, television shows, and theater.
     Superman was born on the fictional planet Krypton and was named Kal-El. As a baby, his parents sent him to 
     Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in 
     the American countryside, near the fictional town of Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan
      and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark developed various superhuman abilities, such as incredible 
      strength and impervious skin. His adoptive parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of
       humanity, and he decided to fight crime. To protect his personal life, he changes into a colorful costume
        and uses the alias "Superman" when fighting crime. Clark resides in the fictional American city of 
        Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the Daily Planet. Superman's supporting characters include
         his love interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane, Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen 
         and editor-in-chief Perry White, and his enemies include Brainiac, General Zod, Darkseid, and his
          archenemy Lex Luthor. Superman is the archetype of the superhero: he wears an outlandish costume, 
          uses a codename, and fights evil with the aid of extraordinary abilities. Although there are earlier 
          characters who arguably fit this definition, it was Superman who popularized the superhero genre and 
          established its conventions. He was the best-selling superhero in American comic books up until the
           1980s.</p>
    <h3>The superhero archetype</h3>
    <img alt="Photo of Superman from Henry Cavill" id="superman-second" src="superman-2.webp">
      <p>Superman is often thought of as the first superhero. This point can be debated: Ogon Bat, the Phantom, 
        Zorro, and Mandrake the Magician arguably fit the definition of the superhero yet predate Superman.
         Nevertheless, Superman popularized this kind of character and established the conventions: a costume,
          a codename, extraordinary abilities, and an altruistic mission. Superman's success in 1938 begat 
          a wave of imitations, which include Batman, Captain America, and Captain Marvel. This flourishing 
          is today referred to as America's Golden Age of Comic Books, which lasted from 1938 to about 1950.
           The Golden Age ended when American superhero book sales declined, leading to the cancellation of 
           many characters; but Superman was one of the few superhero franchises that survived this decline,
            and his sustained popularity into the late 1950s led to a revival in the Silver Age of Comic Books,
             when characters such as Spider-Man, Iron Man, and The X-Men were created. After World War 2, 
             American superhero fiction entered Japanese culture. Astro Boy, first published in 1952, was 
             inspired by Mighty Mouse, which in turn was a parody of Superman. The Superman animated 
             shorts from the 1940s were first broadcast on Japanese television in 1955, and they were followed 
             in 1956 by the TV show Adventures of Superman starring George Reeves. These shows were popular 
             with the Japanese and inspired Japan's own prolific genre of superheroes. The first Japanese 
             superhero movie, Super Giant, was released in 1957. The first Japanese superhero TV show was 
             Moonlight Mask in 1958. Other notable Japanese superheroes include Ultraman, Kamen Rider, and 
             Sailor Moon.</p>
    <h4>Abilities</h4>
    <img alt="Batman Gadgets" id="superman-third" src="superman-3.avif">
            <p>The powers of the DC Comics character Superman have changed a great deal since his introduction in
               the 1930s. As the character developed, his abilities were enhanced in order to maintain the interest
                of his audience. The extent of his powers peaked during the 1960s and - albeit to a lesser extent -
                 the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where it became difficult to create suitable challenges for the 
                 character. As a result, his powers were significantly reduced when his story was rebooted by writer
                  John Byrne after the Crisis on Infinite Earths series. After Byrne's departure, Superman's powers
                   were gradually increased again, although he still remains weaker than his Pre-Crisis incarnation.
                   <br>
                   Superman possesses the powers of flight, superhuman strength, x-ray vision, heat vision, 
                   cold breath, super-speed, enhanced hearing, and nigh-invulnerability. While Superman is 
                   immensely strong both in terms of muscle power and ability to take physical punishment,
                    he is not all-powerful.

    <h5>Enemies</h5>
    <img alt="The enemies of Superman" id="enemies" src="superman-enemies2.avif">
               <p>The villains Superman faced in the earliest stories were ordinary humans, such as gangsters, 
                corrupt politicians, and violent husbands; but they soon grew more colorful and outlandish so as
                 to avoid offending censors or scaring children. The mad scientist Ultra-Humanite, introduced in
                  Action Comics #13 (June 1939), was Superman's first recurring villain. Superman's best-known
                   nemesis, Lex Luthor, was introduced in Action Comics #23 (April 1940) and has been depicted 
                   as either a mad scientist or a wealthy businessman (sometimes both). In 1944, the magical
                    imp Mister Mxyzptlk, Superman's first recurring super-powered adversary, was introduced.[180]
                     Superman's first alien villain, Brainiac, debuted in Action Comics #242 (July 1958). 
                     The monstrous Doomsday, introduced in Superman: The Man of Steel #17-18 (Nov.-Dec. 1992),
                     was the first villain to evidently kill Superman in physical combat without exploiting 
                     Superman's critical weaknesses such as kryptonite and magic.</p>
